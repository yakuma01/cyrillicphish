Thank you for participating in our study. We appreciate your time an effort. You have completed
both our Login task and our survey. We will approve your pay of &#36;2.00 for completing both tasks shortly. We will also ensure that you will get your bonus of &#36;<?php echo $_SESSION['bonusPay'];?> as soon as we are able.

Weâ€™d like to tell you a little more about our study design.<b>The experiment included images of websites that we created and not actual websites.  This study was designed to investigate how different groups perceive risks and privacy in online environments. </b>  
If you have any questions about this study, please do not hesitate to contact us: sancdas@indiana.edu.
