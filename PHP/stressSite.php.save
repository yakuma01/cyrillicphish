		  This study consists of two tasks. The first task is to complete a brief experiment, and the second task is to complete a survey. You will receive $2 for completing these two tasks, but you can earn up to $8 more depending on how quickly you complete the experimental task. As your time on the experimental task increases, your bonus will decrease. You will be able to constantly monitor the elapsed time and bonus payout at the top of the page. Here is a screen shot of the clock that will appear at the top of every page showing elapsed time and bonus payout. The penalty time is explained below. <p>If you manage to take this HIT multiple times <strong>You will only be paid once, for your first attempt. </strong>

		<strong>Experimental Task:</strong> In this experiment, you will be presented with a series of websites, and you will need to decide whether or not to sign-in to each of these sites based on whether or not they are secure. All of the websites are designed to simulate real websites viewed with a Firefox browser, but just like in the real world,the Firefox browser may not be able to ensure the protection of your credentials.</p>
